# Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Terrorism

## Project Overview  
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Global Terrorism Dataset** to identify terrorism hot zones and derive meaningful security insights.  

## Problem Statement  
As a **security/defense analyst**, the objective is to analyze the dataset and find patterns in global terrorism.  
Key questions to answer:  
- What are the major hotspots of terrorism worldwide?  
- What security issues and insights can be derived through data analysis?  
- How can the findings help in strategic decision-making?

## Dataset  
The dataset can be accessed here: [https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5](https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5)  

## Tools Used  
You can use any tool of your choice, including:  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- R  
- Tableau  
- Power BI  
- Excel  
- SAP / SAS  

## Implementation Steps  
1. Load the dataset and perform **data cleaning**.  
2. Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Identify key **trends, patterns, and correlations**.  
   - Find the **regions and countries** most affected by terrorism.  
   - Analyze **attack types, targets, and weapons used**.  
   - Identify **patterns over time**.  
3. Visualize the data using **charts, graphs, and maps**.
